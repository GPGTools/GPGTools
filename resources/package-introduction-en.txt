Thank you for installing GPGTools (version 2011.03.02).

You can chose:
* MacGPG 2.0.17-9 (incl. gpg-pinentry and gpg-agent)
* GPGMail 1.3.2 (for OS X Mail.app)
* GPG Keychain Access 0.8.4 (managing GPG keys)
* GPGServices 1.4 (OS X text service menu for GPG)
* GPGPreferences 0.6 (GPGTools preferences, gpgmail autofix only)
* Enigmail 1.1.2 (for Mozilla Thunderbird)

This will allow you to use OpenPGP on OS X.

Note: please close Mail.app first and have a look at http://gpgtools.org for further information.
